### [TF2] Infinite Buildings

Infinite buildings using the `build` command and the PDA

## Fork modifications
I introduced a cvar to enable or disable the plugin, alongside a check for whether the client is a bot or not. Seems like RCBot2 crashes after hours if this isn't done.

## CVars
- `sm_infbuildings_enable`
    - 1 to enable infinite buildings, 0 to disable.
